## About
Very basic webscraper that scrapes directly from realmeye.com for accurate up to date realmeye information, also very easy to use!

## Usage
```javascript
const realmScrape = require('realmeye-scrape');

realmScrape.getStats(`BTL`).then(stats => {
if (stats == null) { 
  return console.log(`There is no user with that realmeye :(`)
}
  console.log(stats)
});
//=> { name: 'BTL',
//=>   line1: '[LINE ONE REALMEYE DESCRIPTION]', 
//=>   line2: '[LINE TWO REALMEYE DESCRIPTION]', 
//=>   line3: '[LINE THREE REALMEYE DESCRIPTION]' } 
```
## Future Updates
There is **ALOT** more to come just for now it is very small.
